## Hangman.py
### Command line version of the classic game

When starting my programming journey one of the first ideas I had was to make a hangman game.  
However at the time it was too advanced for me and I didn't want to copy other people's work.  
Today I had some free time and decided to do it with the knowledge I acquired.  

TODO:
  - implement better rendering of the hangman as the current one is pretty primitive
  - clean up or find a new dictionary of words since there is a lot of obscure ones in the current one
  - implement colors (who doesn't love colors)
